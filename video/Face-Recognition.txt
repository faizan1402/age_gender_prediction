What is facial recognition and how does it work?
Ans -Facial recognition is a way of recognizing a human face through technology. A facial recognition system
 uses biometrics to map facial features from a photograph or video. It compares the information with a
 database of known faces to find a match.


How Does Face Recognition Work?
Now you must be wondering, “What data does facial recognition use to operate and provide near-accurate results?”

Well, face recognition technology works by identifying specific nodal points of a human face.
Some face recognition software can identify as many as 80 nodal points of a face.
 Along with the help of technologies such as thermal imaging, 3D face mapping, 
skin surface textual analysis, etc., it determines facial features – from the length or width of the nos
and the depth of the eye sockets to the shape of the cheekbones – to create a digital image of an individual’s
face and store the data as a face print. This face print is used every time there is a need to 
compare data captured from faces in a particular image or video frame.

Think of it this way: You recognise most of your friends instantly, even if they are at a distance.
 What makes them recognisable? You look at the shape of their face, eyes, cheeks, lips, nose, etc. 
You identify them by their unique facial features.

How Does Face Recognition Work

Similarly, when a face recognition algorithm identifies a human face, it works on the following steps:

A picture of your face is captured from an image or a video.
The software reads the geometry of your face like you do when trying to recognise someone.
The face reading acquired through a mathematical formula is compared to a database of stored images, 
exactly how your brain would try to identify your friend.
Voila! The software has recognised the face print in its database.
